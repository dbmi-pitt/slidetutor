<h4>General</h4>
<h5><a name="1">What are
intelligent tutoring systems?</a></h5>
<p>Intelligent tutoring systems are adaptive, instructional
systems that try to mimic the well-known benefits of one-on-one
tutoring. The system steps you through the diagnostic process, and
helps you know when you are right or wrong by providing feedback. It
keeps track of what has been done and what still needs to be done. The
system is interactive with the user, providing smart advice about what
the best steps are. An important feature of this kind of system is the
ability to ask for hints at any time if you are unsure what you should
be doing</p>
<h5><a name="2">What is
unique about this tutoring system?</a></h5>
<p> With this tutor the user can enjoy the benefits of
personalized instructions and be in control of what and how he/she
learns. </p>
<h5><a name="3">What is a
virtual slide?</a></h5>
<p> A virtual slide is the digitized image of entire glass
slide
specimens or individual areas of interest by utilizing standard
microscope objectives. The result is a high resolution digital image
with diagnostic quality, viewable on a PC or remotely through a
standard web browser.</p>
<h5><a name="4">What is the
virtual microscope?</a></h5>
<p> A virtual microscope uses a computer instead of a
microscope
to view slides. The same controls on a microscope that allow you to
increase the magnification and move to a different part of the slide
are also available through the computer program.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Get Started</h4>
<h5><a name="5">What are the
system requirements?</a></h5>
<p> You will need a computer with at
least 512 MB of RAM, <a href="http://java.sun.com">Sun
Java (JRE) 1.5</a> or higher installed and broadband Internet
connection.</p>
<h5><a name="6">Can I access
the system using a dial-up connection?</a></h5>
<p> No. Even though system itself runs on the client
computer, it
relies heavily on the Internet connection. The system will be virtually
unusable if a dial-up connection is used.</p>
<h5><a name="7">How do I get
a login account?</a></h5>
<p>Press <span style="font-weight: bold;">Request
Account</span> button in <span style="font-weight: bold;">Use
SlideTutor</span> page.</p>
<h5><a name="8">How do I
learn to use the tutors?</a></h5>
<p> You can use the training manuals and
training videos, which can be found <a href="training.html">here</a>.
Also, using hints when using the tutors will tell you what to do next.</p>
<h5><a name="9">Can I use
the system without having a medical background?</a></h5>
<p>Technically, yes. You can complete any problem just by
following hints. However, to fully appreciate and understand the
system, some medical knowledge is required.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>About the Tutors</h4>
<h5><a name="10">Does the
tutoring system help residents learn?</a></h5>
<p> Our preliminary studies have concluded that there is a
significant learning gain when the system is used by students. On
average, students improve 4-5-fold in their abilities to classify and
report on pathologic findings.</p>
<h5><a name="11">Who would
benefit from using this system?</a></h5>
<p> The system is intended for pathology residents;
however,
people of any level, from medical students to general pathologists may
also benefit from using the system.</p>
<h5><a name="12">Do I need a
certain level of expertise before using the system?</a></h5>
<p> No expertise is needed to use the system. However,
without at
least some medical knowledge, the system will make little sense. The
system was originally intended for pathology residents and fellows,
however practicing pathologists are also using the system.</p>
<h5><a name="13">On what
basis does the system score my answers?</a></h5>
<p> There is no scoring in the system. The system requires
correct input for the goals that the human expert considers to be
important.</p>
<h5><a name="14">Is the
system available for learning other areas?</a></h5>
<p> Not at the present time, but we are planning to include
a
broader range of areas over the next five years.</p>
<h5><a name="15">How does
the system know what advice to give when I ask for help?</a></h5>
<p>Each case has a set of goals. When an error is detected
in one
of the goals, the system will assist users in completing or correcting
that goal. If there are no outstanding errors, the system will suggest
the next goal in the solution path.</p>
<h5><a name="16">What kind
of curriculum does the system use?</a></h5>
<p>The curriculum covers many types of inflammatory
diseases of
skin, and all melanocytic lesions of skin including melanoma and
melanocytic nevi.</p>
<h5><a name="17">How were
the cases selected?</a></h5>
<p> The cases were selected based on a set of diagnoses
that
showed the most typical features for a diagnosis. All cases were
approved by our expert pathologist to ensure that the cases were not
too difficult to interpret.</p>
<h5><a name="18">How do I
know what the Writing Tutor is teaching me is correct?</a></h5>
<p> The Writing Tutor&#8217;s knowledge is based on the College
of
American Pathologists (CAP) protocols and checklists. CAP produces
cancer protocols as a resource to pathologists in effectively
delivering the information necessary to provide quality patient care.
The protocols consist of cancer case summaries (checklists) accompanied
by background documentation. The background documentation includes
detailed outlines, explanatory notes, and references. The American
College of Surgeons Commission on Cancer (ACS CoC) has recognized the
value of the CAP cancer checklists in caring for cancer patients.
Starting January 1, 2004, it mandated that pathologists at CoC-approved
cancer programs include only the scientifically validated or regularly
used data elements of the checklists in their surgical pathology
reports on cancer specimens.</p>
<h5><a name="19">How does
the system understand different writing styles/wordings of things?</a></h5>
<p> The system parses the input text into phrases and uses
controlled terminology to extract known concepts from those phrases.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Using the Tutors</h4>
<h5><a name="20">Why can&#8217;t I
report on something while using the Diagnostic Tutor?</a></h5>
<p> You must complete working through a case with the
Diagnostic
Tutor before you can move on to the Writing Tutor.</p>
<h5><a name="21">What do I
do if I&#8217;m stuck and don&#8217;t know what to do next?</a></h5>
<p> ou can ask for hints at any time while using the tutor.
When
you are not sure what to do next, asking for hints is a good way to
make progress because hints will help move you along towards completing
the case. Hints can be used to get all the way through the problem.</p>
<h5><a name="22">Will I have
to go through each case twice (once with each tutor)?</a></h5>
<p> No. The tutor keeps track of everything that has been
done
from the beginning of the case, so anything that has been done in the
Diagnostic Tutor will not need to be redone in the Writing Tutor.
Features will need to be mentioned in reports, but you will not need to
search for them on the slides in both the Diagnostic and Writing parts
of the system.</p>
<h5><a name="23">How long
does it take to work through a case?</a></h5>
<p> People work at different paces, but on average, it
takes
about a half hour to work through a case. The first case normally takes
longer while you are getting used to the system.</p>
<h5><a name="24">Why won&#8217;t
the tutor let me move on to the next case?</a></h5>
<p> The tutor will not allow users to move on to the next
case
until
they have completely worked through the current case. You cannot skip
cases.</p>
<h5><a name="25">What do I
do if the Writing Tutor doesn&#8217;t understand what I am saying?</a></h5>
<p> There could be two reasons for this. One is that you
are not
saying
something that is considered important to include in a report. The
system is designed to only recognize key items, and will only highlight
those. The other possibility is that you are saying something that
should be included, but it is not worded in a way the system
understands. In this case, try wording it another way, or asking for
help.</p>
<h5><a name="26">Where can I
get help with the Diagnostic Tutor?</a></h5>
<p> Please see the <a href="manuals/DiagnosticTutor%20Training%20Manual%20%28case%20based%29.pdf">training
manual</a> for additional information. </p>
<h5><a name="27">Where can I
get help with Writing Tutor?</a></h5>
<p> Please see the <a href="manuals/PrognosticTutor%20Training%20Manual%20%28Blue%29.pdf">training
manual</a> for additional information. </p>
<h5><a name="28">How can I
get additional information?</a></h5>
<p> You can request additional
information by <a href="contact.html">contacting us</a>
by email with your request. Several publications are available on the
tutors. (<a href="publications.html">http://slidetutor.upmc.edu/publications.htm</a>l)</p>
<p></p>
<h4> Other</h4>
<h5><a name="29">Who else
can see/has access to my progress with the tutor?</a></h5>
<p> All the data has been de-identified for research
analysis and
data
mining. No one has access to records linked to your name or to any
identifying information. </p>
<h5><a name="30">Can I
participate in the development of the tutors?</a></h5>
<p> Yes. You can contribute cases for use in the tutoring
system
and help with testing. Please contact us if you are interested.</p>
<h5><a name="31">Can the
system be used for diagnosis/reporting of real cases?</a></h5>
<p> No. The system is a learning tool and should not be
used for
diagnosis of a real case.</p>
<!--
<h5><a name="32">How does
the virtual slide quality compare with the real microscope?</a></h5>
<p> Although the virtual slide quality is
not as good as the quality with a real microscope, the virtual slide
does allow the user to identify all of the features needed in
diagnostic report writing.</p>
-->
<h5><a name="33">Can I
include the tutors in my in-class curriculum?</a></h5>
<p> Yes. Please notify us if you are
planning to so do.</p>
<h5><a name="35">Will my personal information be shared with anyone?</a></h5>
<p> No. We will not share any identifying information, such as your name or
username with anyone. Aggregate information about how users work in our
system may be used to help us improve the system, or understand
learning in this domain. &nbsp;But this information will never be associated
to your identifying information, or provided to any outside party.&nbsp;
