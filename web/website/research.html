<h3>Predicting diagnostic performance</h3>
Multiple choice tests are generally poor predictors of skilled
performance in real world decision making, such as medical diagnosis. A
central aspect of the SlideTutor project is to develop the necessary
formalisms for measuring and predicting diagnostic performance.
SlideTutor captures a wealth of data about intermediate steps and
skills, from which our Hidden Markov Models learn a model of individual
skill acquisition over time.&nbsp; We are currently working on
improving our low level models. Future work will focus on aggregating
these models to predict student performance at the case level.
<p></p>
<h3>Measuring and enhancing metacognition</h3>
An often neglected aspect of expert medical performance is the ability
to accurately predict one&#8217;s own performance. Ongoing projects in our
group are focused on determining what aspects of tutoring lead to
over-confidence and under-confidence in self assessment of performance.
<p></p>
<h3>Detecting and correcting cognitive biases</h3>
We are currently exploring whether SlideTutor can detect heuristic
errors (cognitive biases) such as representativeness and
pseudo-diagnosticity. Current projects include development of
production rules to capture biases and development of measurement
instruments for validating SlideTutor&#8217;s inferences. Future work will
focus on how to use the system to reduce these errors.<br>

<h3>Evaluating SlideTutor as a patient safety intervention</h3>
In collaboration with Dana Grzybicki, MD,PhD at University of Colorado,
we are testing whether SlideTutor reduces diagnostic errors among
practicing pathologists, when compared to standard continuing medical
education. This work represents the first summative evaluation of an
intelligent tutoring system in any medical domain.<br>
<p>
</p>
<h3>Enhancement, deployment and integration of SlideTutor</h3>
We are now extending the SlideTutor system to other areas of pathology,
enhancing the authoring system, and integrating the system into real
workflows.

<h3>The Cancer Training Web &#8211; a distributed Intelligent
Tutoring System</h3>
In collaboration with George Xu, MD, PhD at University of Pennsylvania,
we are working on the development of technology for a distributed
tutoring system. This project moves us closer to the vision of a
Semantic Web for Medical Education. </td>
