<p>SlideTutor is an educational system that can be used by
pathology
residents, fellows and practicing pathologists, to learn how to arrive
at a correct pathologic diagnosis and how to accurately report their
findings. SlideTutor uses &#8220;virtual slides&#8221; that you can examine just as
you would look at cases under your microscope, but also provides space
for you to describe what you are seeing and deciding, as well as space
to type your report.
</p>
<p>SlideTutor is an example of a new kind of computer based
medical
education &#8211; a cognitive tutor and simulator that provides immediate
feedback as you work. SlideTutor monitors your work, and steps in with
helpful explanations if you make a mistake. SlideTutor can also provide
advice to help you move efficiently down the correct reasoning path. As
you work, SlideTutor keeps track of how you are learning, and adapts
its' interaction to fit your specific educational needs.
</p>
<p>Studies in our laboratory have shown that SlideTutor is
highly
effective. On average, students are able to improve their diagnostic
and reporting performance by a factor of four after as little as 4
hours of use of the system. [1][2]
